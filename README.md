# Cancer-Project
Model county cancer rates to decided where to place a distribution center


## Overview
In this project I use data from cancer.gov, clinicaltrials.gov, and the American Community Survey data.  From there I create linear models to predict cancer rates
in any given American County.  After creating a model that has above 90% accuracy, I put myself in the shoes of a potenial distributor that has a cure, and decided 
where to build facotries given limited resources.  At, the bottom there is a small conclusion part, and mini write ups included after many major code blocks
